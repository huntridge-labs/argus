# Argus SDK Roadmap

Tracks what has been completed and what remains for the argus Python SDK migration.

---

## Completed

### Phase 1: Core SDK + CLI
- [x] `argus/core/models.py` — Severity enum (with comparison operators, multi-format parsing), Finding, ScanResult, ScanSummary dataclasses with `to_dict()`
- [x] `argus/core/scanner.py` — Scanner Protocol (scan, is_available, install_command, container_image, container_args)
- [x] `argus/core/config.py` — ArgusConfig, ScannerConfig, ReportingConfig, ExecutionConfig loaded from `argus.yml` via pyyaml
- [x] `argus/core/engine.py` — ArgusEngine orchestrating scanner registration, execution (local + Docker fallback), result aggregation
- [x] `argus/cli.py` — argparse CLI: `argus scan [scanner] --config --path --format --severity-threshold --output-dir --list --verbose`; `argus report`
- [x] `argus/__main__.py` — `python -m argus` entry point
- [x] Zero external dependencies beyond pyyaml

### Phase 2: Scanner Modules
- [x] 10 scanner modules, each implementing the Scanner protocol:
  - `bandit.py` — Python SAST (parses Bandit JSON)
  - `clamav.py` — malware detection (parses clamscan text output)
  - `trivy_iac.py` — IaC misconfigurations (parses Trivy JSON)
  - `gitleaks.py` — secrets detection (parses Gitleaks JSON array)
  - `osv.py` — dependency vulnerabilities (parses OSV-Scanner JSON)
  - `checkov.py` — IaC policy checks (parses Checkov JSON, handles list/dict output)
  - `opengrep.py` — pattern-based SAST (parses OpenGrep/Semgrep JSON)
  - `supply_chain.py` — GitHub Actions security (combines zizmor SARIF + actionlint JSON)
  - `zap.py` — DAST (parses ZAP JSON, strips HTML from descriptions)
  - `container.py` — container scanning (orchestrates trivy+grype+syft, CVE deduplication)
- [x] All `parse_results()` methods are public and independently testable with fixtures
- [x] All `container_args()` methods derive behavior from config dict (no hardcoded values)

### Reporters
- [x] `terminal.py` — ASCII tables with severity counts to stdout
- [x] `markdown.py` — collapsible sections, emoji severity indicators
- [x] `sarif.py` — SARIF 2.1.0 with per-scanner runs
- [x] `json_report.py` — full summary serialization via `to_dict()`

### Docker Execution Backend
- [x] Engine auto-falls back to Docker when tools not installed locally
- [x] `argus/containers.py` — central image manifest (9 official + 3 custom images)
- [x] ARM64 fallback: retries with `--platform linux/amd64` when native pull fails
- [x] Container stdout capture for scanners that write to stdout (ClamAV)
- [x] `container_entrypoint` support for images with non-tool entrypoints (ClamAV)
- [x] Registry override via `execution.registry` config for air-gapped environments
- [x] Pull policy: `always`, `if-not-present`, `never`
- [x] Custom Dockerfiles: `docker/Dockerfile.bandit`, `docker/Dockerfile.opengrep`, `docker/Dockerfile.supply-chain`, `docker/Dockerfile.cli`

### Testing (SDK)
- [x] 202 unit tests in `argus/tests/`, 83%+ coverage
- [x] Core tests: models (42), config (19), engine (18), CLI (20), containers (10)
- [x] Scanner tests: all 10 scanners tested with fixture data from `tests/fixtures/scanner-outputs/`
- [x] Reporter tests: terminal (8), markdown (8), SARIF (8), JSON (6)
- [x] Docker backend tests: image resolution, registry override, local-vs-container fallback

### CI/CD Dogfooding
- [x] `security-scan.yml` — runs `pip install pyyaml && python -m argus scan --config argus.yml` (no manual tool installs)
- [x] `argus.yml` — dogfood config: bandit, gitleaks, opengrep, clamav, osv, supply-chain enabled
- [x] `test-reusable-workflows.yml` — refactored to test argus CLI (listing, scanning, output validation)

### CI/CD Hardening
- [x] `test-actions.yml` — removed job-level `continue-on-error: true` from 23 jobs; added `test-results` gate job; fixed ZAP/ClamAV to run on PRs
- [x] `test-unit.yml` — Python version matrix (3.11, 3.12, 3.13); version ref coverage check
- [x] `test-examples-functional.yml` — minimum example count gate (prevents empty-matrix passes)
- [x] `.release-it.json` — added package.json to regex-bumper output
- [x] `scripts/ci/check_version_refs.py` — added `.claude`, `.agents` to SKIP_DIRS

### Deprecated Workflow Removal

## Remaining: Phase 5 — Agentic Substrate (CLI + MCP + Skill)

Products that serve developer workflows increasingly need three layers for AI assistant integration. Argus already ships a CLI. Phase 5 adds the MCP server and refines the skill to complete the stack.

### The three layers

| Layer | Role | Context cost | Update mechanism |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CLI** | Universal fallback — works everywhere, no AI integration needed | Zero (not loaded into context) | `pip install --upgrade` |
| **MCP server** | Structured execution — typed tools, JSON responses, deferred loading | Deferred (tool schemas load only when invoked) | Ships with the pip package |
| **Skill** | Routing — tells the agent *when* to reach for Argus and *how* to reason about security scanning | Minimal (lightweight strategy text, always loaded) | Published to skills.sh or bundled in repo |

**Why all three matter:**

An MCP server eagerly loads all its tool definitions into the agent's context window. If Argus exposes 5-6 tools, that's token budget consumed in every conversation even when the user isn't doing security scanning. The skill acts as the gatekeeper — a lightweight instruction that tells the agent "when the task involves security scanning, reach for the Argus MCP." Tool schemas only enter context when actually needed. The CLI remains the fallback for environments without MCP support, CI pipelines, and direct human use.

This is the pattern emerging across the industry: CLI for humans and CI, MCP for structured AI execution, skills for AI routing and strategy. Companies from security tools to workflow automation are shipping all three.

### Why we initially considered MCP-only (and why that was incomplete)

We explored replacing skills entirely with MCP (see ADR-015 discussion history). The concerns about skills were valid:
- Copying a full 300-line skill into a project creates a stale snapshot
- No universal skill format across AI tools
- Duplicated intelligence between skill and engine

The resolution: **the skill doesn't need to encode implementation details.** With MCP handling execution, the skill shrinks to a routing/strategy layer — when to scan, what Argus is good for, how to interpret results at a high level. That lightweight skill rarely changes because it describes Argus's *purpose*, not its *API surface*. The MCP server self-describes its tools, so the skill doesn't need to.

### MCP server

**Tools:**

| Tool | Parameters | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `argus_detect` | `path` | Detected project signals (languages, frameworks, IaC, containers) |
| `argus_scan` | `scanners`, `path`, `severity_threshold` | Structured findings with severity, file, line, rule, message |
| `argus_validate` | `config_path` | Validation errors and warnings for argus.yml |
| `argus_list_scanners` | — | Available scanners with install status and descriptions |
| `argus_init` | `path`, `platform` | Generated config content and file paths |

**Resources:**

| Resource URI | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `argus://config` | Current argus.yml parsed as structured data |
| `argus://results/latest` | Most recent scan results from the last run |

**User setup:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argus": {
      "command": "argus",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Skill (routing layer)

The existing skill at `.agents/skills/argus-scanner-selection/` is a 300-line reference that encodes scanner selection logic, CLI syntax, and interpretation rules. With MCP handling execution, this gets refactored into a slim routing skill:

- **When** to invoke Argus (code changes, pre-push checks, CI setup, security review)
- **What** Argus covers (SAST, secrets, dependencies, IaC, containers, DAST, supply chain, malware)
- **How** to reach for it (prefer MCP tools if available, fall back to CLI)
- **How** to interpret results (severity thresholds, false positive patterns, remediation guidance)

The scanner selection logic, CLI argument construction, and output parsing move entirely to the MCP server. The skill becomes stable strategy that rarely needs updating.

**Distribution:** Publish to [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for discovery. The skill file in `.agents/skills/` remains as the canonical source in the repo.

### Dependencies and portability considerations

The MCP server is a new interface to the existing engine — it does not change the scanner dependency story. Scanners still require either local binaries or Docker. Key considerations:

- Pure Python scanners (bandit, checkov, osv) work without Docker
- Binary scanners (gitleaks, trivy, opengrep) need Docker or local install
- `argus_list_scanners` should clearly report what's available and what's missing
- Graceful degradation: scans return partial results with clear "unavailable" status per scanner rather than failing entirely
- Phase 3 (portability) should land first to maximize the set of scanners that work out of the box

### Implementation — completed

<details><summary>MCP server (13 items)</summary>

- [x] `argus/mcp.py` — 8 tools, 3 resources, 3 prompts, stdio transport
- [x] 69 tests across 11 test classes, documentation, init hint

</details>

<details><summary>Skill refactor (4 items)</summary>

- [x] Slimmed to 66-line routing/strategy layer with version frontmatter (0.7.2)
- [x] MCP-first instructions, scanner logic moved to MCP tool descriptions

</details>

### Remaining
- [ ] Publish skill to [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/)
