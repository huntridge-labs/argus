# AI Configuration - Anthropic (Claude)
# This file demonstrates AI provider settings for Anthropic's Claude models
# Copy to .github/ai-config.yml and customize as needed

# AI is activated by the enable_ai_fallback action input (not by this config file).
# This file only configures AI behavior (provider, model, thresholds).

# AI Provider: 'anthropic'
provider: 'anthropic'

# Model selection (choose based on your needs)
# - claude-3-haiku-20240307: Fastest, cheapest, good for routine classification
# - claude-3-sonnet-20240229: Balanced speed/quality
# - claude-3-opus-20240229: Highest quality, slower, more expensive
model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307'

# Confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
# AI classifications below this confidence are marked as MANUAL_REVIEW
# Higher = more conservative (more manual reviews)
# Lower = more automated (fewer manual reviews but less certain)
confidence_threshold: 0.8

# Maximum tokens for AI response
# 1024 is sufficient for JSON classification responses
max_tokens: 1024

# Maximum characters from diff to include in AI prompt
# Larger values = more context but higher cost
# 1000 is usually enough to understand the change
max_diff_chars: 1000
