# Bandit Python Security Scanner - Reusable Workflow
#
# THIN WRAPPER: This workflow delegates to the scanner-bandit composite action.
# All scanning logic is in: .github/actions/scanner-bandit/action.yml
#
# For GHES users: Use the composite action directly instead of this workflow.
# See: examples/github-enterprise/sast-only.yml
