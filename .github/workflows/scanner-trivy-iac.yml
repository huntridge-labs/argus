# Trivy IaC Scanner - Reusable Workflow
#
# THIN WRAPPER: This workflow delegates to the scanner-trivy-iac composite action.
# All scanning logic is in: .github/actions/scanner-trivy-iac/action.yml
#
# For GHES users: Use the composite action directly instead of this workflow.
# See: examples/github-enterprise/infrastructure-scanning.yml
