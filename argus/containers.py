# Official images from tool authors (used directly, not rebuilt by argus).
#
# Every entry is pinned to a ``tag@sha256:...`` digest reference so that
# Docker's pull-time content-hash check enforces the exact bytes we
# tested against — making the image content-addressable and tamper-
# evident regardless of whether the publisher re-tags the same tag
# later. This pairs with ``argus.core.image_verify``: third-party
# images with a digest pin take the ``VERIFIED_DIGEST_PIN`` path
# instead of the ``SKIPPED_TAG_PIN`` warn-only path, closing the
# supply-chain gap surfaced in the post-PR-146 audit.
#
# Renovate (.github/renovate.json) keeps both the tag and the digest current
# on a 7-day stability lag — when the upstream publisher cuts a new
# release, Renovate rewrites BOTH the version segment and the digest
# segment in a single PR.

# Per-scanner notes:
#   - trivy   (aquasec/trivy:0.70.0)         runs as root; ``/root/.cache/trivy`` is the
#                                            default DB location. Mount works for ``trivy``
#                                            (vuln scan); ``trivy-iac`` does not populate
#                                            the DB so the dir stays empty for that path.
#   - grype   (anchore/grype:v0.112.0)       runs as root; standard XDG cache dir.
#   - semgrep (opengrep) — runs as root; cache at ``/root/.semgrep`` (rules + metadata).
#   - checkov (bridgecrew/checkov:3.2.526)   runs as root; ``/root/.checkov`` mostly
#                                            holds telemetry / version-check metadata —
#                                            persistence here is low-value but harmless.
#
# Clamav is deliberately NOT listed here. The official ``clamav/clamav`` image runs as
# the unprivileged ``clamav`` system user, which can't write to a host-owned bind mount
# at ``/var/lib/clamav`` — freshclam then segfaults with "Can't create freshclam.dat"
# (issue #168-N). The clamav scanner now writes its DB to ``/tmp/clamav-db`` per-run via
# ``freshclam --datadir`` (see argus/scanners/clamav.py); there is nothing host-side to
# cache, so listing clamav here only re-triggered the segfault by re-mounting the bad path.
