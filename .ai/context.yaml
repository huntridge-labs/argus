project:
  name: argus
  type: security-pipeline
  purpose: "Automated security scanning orchestration for GitHub Actions"
  primary_language: yaml  # GitHub Actions workflows
  secondary_languages: [python]
  version: "2.12.0"
  license: "AGPL-3.0"
  repository: "huntridge-labs/argus"

  one_liner: >
    Reusable GitHub Actions workflows + composite actions that orchestrate
    14 security scanners with unified interface, SARIF upload, PR comments.

  solves:
    - Running multiple security scanners from single workflow call
    - Unified severity thresholds across different scanner outputs
    - GitHub Enterprise Server compatibility for security scanning
    - PR feedback with inline code annotations

  does_not_solve:
    - Remediation of found vulnerabilities (reporting only)
    - Custom scanner development (uses existing tools)
    - Security policy enforcement (provides data, not gates)

common_tasks:
  run_all_scanners: "Call the reusable workflow to run the default scanner suite."
  run_subset: "Enable a subset of scanners via workflow inputs or config."
  view_reports: "Review SARIF uploads, PR comments, and summary reports."
  update_versions: "Bump scanner or action versions and validate outputs."
  troubleshoot_failures: "Inspect workflow logs and scanner outputs to resolve errors."

primary_users:
  - DevSecOps engineers setting up CI/CD pipelines
  - Security teams wanting automated scanning
  - Platform teams supporting multiple repositories

platforms:
  supported:
    - github-actions

  constraints:
    - "v2.x requires github.com or GHES with github.com access"
    - "v3.0 works on isolated GHES"
    - "Must support air-gapped environments"
